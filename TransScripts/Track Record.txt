Let's see how we can track the item and how the state of the item is stored on the blockchain. Let's enter the item id of the already delivered item. 
The current holder shows the wallet address of the person who owns the item now, in this case, it is the GAIL manager.
Time or arrival is the time when the item arrived at this stage.
Update state we saw while ago, updates this time of arrival.
The time of shipping is the time when the item is shipped from this stage, It is zero in this case as the GAIL manager is the final stop.
Ship next functionality we saw, we had to enter the next stop address, that's recorded in the next expected stop, Again it's null in this case.
The vendor contains the vendor address.
The quotation is a winning bid.
a row of Delivered signifies weather the item is delivered.

We can also see the complete path under get record.
Here each step Signifies, the state item has gone through.
As you can see in this case there is Vendor, One Intermediary and GAIL at last.
This Complete path is recorded on the blockchain only, hence it is immutable, transparent, decentralized, and distributed. 

Thank you
