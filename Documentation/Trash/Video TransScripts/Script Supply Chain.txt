Welcome, Let's see how the item moves through the decentralized application we created. Let's start with the Vendor. Once Item is allotted to the vendor. the vendor gets a notification by email from the GAIL manager. Then the vendor prepares that item for shipment. He creates a unique QR code. The vendor goes to the portal and selects the ship next option. here in address field vendor has to select the intermediary he prefers from the list. Then he has to scan the QR code of the item. This is scanning. The browser will require a confirmation from you for mining this state to the ethereum. Next Item moves in the supply chain by various means of transportation.

Once item has arrived at an intermediary. The intermediary has to update the state of the item by scanning QR code. This signifies that the item is in the warehouse of an intermediary. Once the item is ready to get shipped to the next stop, The intermediary ships item using ship next option the same as the vendor.
There can be multiple intermediaries between Vendor and GAIL. Item travels through all of the intermediaries, and its state is maintained on the blockchain throughout the supply chain.
Once the item has arrived at GAIL. The manager has to update the state that the item is arrived by scanning the QR code. Once Item reaches GAIL then only Payment is done to the vendor based on the quotation.
This is how the item moves through the supply chain.
