### This project was built as a solution to problem statement in SIH2020
## Problem Statement BK225
GAIL procures most of the raw materials, items, office supplies and services through public procurement portal based on tendering system. We need to develop a Blockchain secured system to control this procurement process. 
As an example, 
Developer shall implement end-to-end process for Steel-pipes, that contains steps like 
A)procurement from Indian/Overseas vendor B)Shipping C) Transportation in intermediary points D) acceptance at GAIL store E) Payment to Vendor using smart contracts 
The implementation should use Open source technologies like Ethereum or equivalent and be able to show simple and good UI + clear documentation with out of the box thinking
## Our Approach
**Functional**</br>
Supply Chain :</br>
Blockchain maintains state of each item in supply chain. Complete  Supply chain is maintained/accessed/updated through Ethereum only.</br>
Procurement :</br>
Tenders are created, allotted on public network only. Bidders can bid with their bid and quotation.</br>

**Technical**</br>
dApp access ethereum node through infura for updating/accessing state of eth. Client side is hosted on IPFS, to make it completely decentralized application.</br>
